## Motivation
To satisfy the requirements of high query throughput and low query latency, data processing systems constantly adapt to novel  hardware features, but usually in a _hardware-conscious_ way.

## Hardware-oblivious concept

Generally, the implementation of query operators is very hardware-specific and any change or evolving of the underlying hardware leads to significant implementation and maintenance activities.
