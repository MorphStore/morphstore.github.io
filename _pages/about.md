MorphStore is an in-memory columnar analytical query engine with a novel holistic compression-enabeld and highly-vectorized processing model. 

## Motivation
With increasingly large amounts of data being collected in numerous application areas ranging from science to industry, the importance of online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads increases constantly. OLAP queries typically access a small number of columns, but a high number of rows and are, thus, most efficiently stored and processed by column-stores. Moreover, the significant developments in the main memory domain in recent years have rendered it possible to keep even large data sets entirely in main memory. For these reasons, in-memory column-store approaches have established themselves as state-of-the-art for OLAP workloads.
