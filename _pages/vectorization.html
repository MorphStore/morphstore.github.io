To satisfy the requirements of high query throughput and low query latency, data processing systems constantly adapt to novel 
hardware features, but usually in a _hardware-conscious_ way. That means, the implementations of, for example, 
query operators is very hardware-specific and any change or development of the underlying hardware leads to significant 
implementation and maintenance activities.
